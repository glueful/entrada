## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Production Ready with Modern Extension System

This is the first stable production release of the Entrada (Social Login & SSO) extension. Version 1.0.0 marks a significant milestone with full migration to Glueful's modern extension architecture:

- **Modern Extension System**: Fully migrated to the new extension architecture as outlined in the [Modern Extensions System](https://github.com/glueful/framework/blob/main/docs/implementation_plans/MODERN_EXTENSIONS_SYSTEM.md)
- **Standardized Structure**: Follows the new extension cookbook guidelines from [Extension Development](https://github.com/glueful/framework/blob/main/docs/cookbook/15-extensions.md)
- **Complete Documentation**: Extensive PHP usage examples and implementation patterns
- **Stable API**: All provider interfaces are stable and production-tested
- **Framework Integration**: Full compatibility with Glueful's latest router and response systems
- **Production Hardened**: All critical bugs fixed and error handling improved
- **Developer Ready**: Comprehensive examples for all common use cases

Key architectural improvements:
- Service provider extends new base classes
- Proper metadata in `extra.glueful` composer configuration
- Standardized directory structure (src/, config/, migrations/, routes/)
- Extension discovery and auto-loading support
- Dependency management and version requirements

The extension is now ready for production deployments with confidence and fully compatible with Glueful's modern extension ecosystem.

### Version 0.18.0 Highlights

This major release establishes the SocialLogin extension as an enterprise-grade OAuth authentication solution. Key improvements include:

- **Complete Multi-Provider Support**: Full implementation for Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Apple
- **Dual Authentication Flows**: Support for both web applications and native mobile apps
- **Advanced Apple Integration**: Custom ASN.1 parser and comprehensive Sign In with Apple support
- **Enterprise Security**: CSRF protection, JWT validation, and secure token management
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive API documentation and health monitoring

### Upgrade Notes

When upgrading to 0.18.0:
1. Update your OAuth provider configurations in environment variables
2. Run the database migration to create the social_accounts table
3. Test both web and mobile authentication flows
4. Update your frontend applications to use the new API endpoints
5. Configure Apple Sign In if using iOS applications

### Breaking Changes

- OAuth callback URLs have been standardized (update your provider configurations)
- Database schema now requires the social_accounts table migration
- Some configuration keys have been reorganized for consistency
- API responses now follow a standardized format across all providers

### Migration Guide

#### Database Migration
Run the migration to create the required table:
```bash
php glueful migrate run
```

#### Configuration Migration
Update your environment variables to the new format:

```env
# Google (updated format)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/social/google/callback

# Apple (new provider)
APPLE_CLIENT_ID=com.yourdomain.services.id
APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET=/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
APPLE_TEAM_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
APPLE_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
APPLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/social/apple/callback
```

#### API Integration
Update your frontend code to use the new endpoints:

```javascript
// Web OAuth Flow (unchanged)
window.location.href = '/auth/social/google';

// New: Native Mobile Flow
const response = await fetch('/auth/social/google', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id_token: googleIdToken,
    access_token: googleAccessToken
  })
});
```

### Apple Sign In Setup

For Apple Sign In, you'll need:
1. Apple Developer account with Services ID configured
2. Private key (.p8 file) for JWT generation
3. Domain verification with Apple
4. Proper redirect URI configuration

### Security Considerations

- All OAuth flows now include CSRF protection
- Provider tokens are validated against official APIs
- JWT tokens use Glueful's secure TokenManager
- Social account data is properly encrypted in storage

### Performance Improvements

- Provider public keys are cached for faster validation
- Connection pooling reduces API call overhead
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- JWT validation results are cached to minimize external requests
